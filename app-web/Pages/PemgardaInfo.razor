            Pemgarda is requested for <b>&lt;patient name&gt</b>.<br />
            Pemgarda is a pre-exposure prophylactic (PrEP) monoclonal antibody recently given Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the FDA for prevention of Covid in high risk patients. It is given by IV.<br />
            If not yet included, the drug will need to be added to the <b>&lt;institution name&gt</b> formulary. (list of approved medicines)<br />
            It can be ordered from major distributors, details are in this guide: <a href="https://www.pemgarda.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/PEMGARDA-Product-Ordering-Guide_041624.pdf" target="_blank">Pemgarda.com's ordering guide</a> [1]<br />

            It will be covered by Medicare akin to a Covid vaccine.The CMS codes are Q0224 for the drug and M0224 for the infusion.<br />
            <br />
            <b>&lt;Patient name&gt</b> has <b>&lt;insurer name&gt</b> commercial insurance. Since Pemgarda is new to the market, most commercial insurers including <b>&lt;insurer name&gt</b> have not yet added it to their drug lists or completed normal approval procedures.<br />
            Some insurance companies have advised a generic prior authorization form be submitted for the patient with the above Medicare CMS codes, marked Urgent to expedite. The Medicare CMS codes should allow the insurer to see the drug in their system where they otherwise can’t.<br />
            It’s understood this PA (prior authorization) will be denied, however the submission should open a case so that an individual approval process can begin. Once <b>&lt;insurer name&gt</b> has the info it needs and the process complete,they should approve.<br />
            Thank you<br />

    <div>
        Any infusion center should be able to administer Pemgarda. There are about 6,000 infusion centers in the United States.<br/>
        However, infusion centers likely need to add it to their list of approved medicines. Our goal is to provide a list of infusion centers that can administer Pemgarda...but until then this locator of all 6,000 infusion centers in the nation may help you get contact information for nearby centers:<a href="https://www.infusionaccessfoundation.org/locator/" target="_blank">infusionaccessfoundation.org/locator/</a><br />
        <br />
        Contacting one or more centers near you, will provide a starting point to find an infusion center that can administer Pemgarda. They may not know about Pemgarda yet, communicating the information from the doctor message above may help them learn about it.<br/>

    <h5>Payment via Medicare</h5>
    <div>
        Pemgarda will be covered by Medicare akin to a Covid vaccine.The CMS codes are Q0224 for the drug and M0224 for the infusion.<br />
    </div>
    <br/>
    <h5>Payment via Private Insurance</h5>
    <div>
        Since Pemgarda is new to the market, most commercial insurers have not yet added it to their drug lists or completed normal approval procedures.<br />
        Some insurance companies have advised a generic prior authorization form be submitted for the patient with Medicare CMS codes (Q0224 for the drug and M0224 for the infusion), marked Urgent to expedite. The Medicare CMS codes should allow the insurer to see the drug in their system where they otherwise can’t.<br />
        Generally this PA (prior authorization) will be denied, however the submission should open a case so that an individual approval process can begin. Once <b>&lt;insurer name&gt</b> has the info it needs and the process complete,they should approve.<br />
        <br/>
        We plan to add a list of the progess with different Insurance companies as soon as possible.
