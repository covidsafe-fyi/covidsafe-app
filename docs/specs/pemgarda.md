DB currently, we are not sure which infusion centers should be listed on a locator‚Ä¶although we‚Äôve only had one discussion so far. Would love any feedback from community on how getting a prescription, finding an infusion center that will administer, and getting insurance approval could be helped by CovidSafe.fyi or others.

### DB
Rob Relyea yes, those are the big three and we‚Äôre still flushing out answers.

Perhaps to start it could be a place where patients could be directed to best and recent info?

For scripts, based on responses some of our group have received, it‚Äôs obvious a bit of info might need to be disseminated to help things along. So adding the Pemgarda ordering sheet, provider care sheet, EUA etc, to the site could be helpful so folks can grab it and send to their provider.

For infusion centers that will administer, at least initially and until Invivyd gets their sales team in place, would it be possible to crowdsource a bit as we did with Evusheld? Some of us have been calling around and updating here and other groups but Paragon is the first location I know of so far that‚Äôs actually gotten it in their formulary. Since it‚Äôs a commercial rollout vs government, I‚Äôm told it likely won‚Äôt be ‚Äúin stock‚Äù most places as Evusheld was. Rather, once the script, approval, and assurance of reimbursement is complete, the product can be shipped to any licensed pharmacy/provider with next day delivery. For me just knowing someplace near me who has it in their formulary where I can hopefully get the ball rolling is a helpful start, so perhaps to begin it includes infusion centers we know of who do have it in their formulary and be contacted. Then, hopefully we can expand it as patients successfully get access.

Rob - send Diane Barron a spreadsheet...with address/phone/website/notes...

compendia/formulary -- pharmacy...once it is added, it can be requested.

paragon ... would work with insurance.
NDC code...a drug code...they an insurance company has in their system.
with medicare codes...insurance company can find info...

https://locator.patientaccess.org/

could invivyd collect info...on who they shipped it to.


insurance companies can also give list of infusion centers...


Medicare - it‚Äôs my understanding that process should go most swiftly since the agreement is in place but perhaps the site could include information about Medicare coverage including the above CMS codes and cost/coverage information as we currently understand it. It is supposed to be covered akin to a vaccine by Medicare but I‚Äôve heard conflicting info on whether that means no out of pocket cost or not so would need to nail that down.
Commercial insurance- I think this is where it‚Äôs going to get sticky, take the longest and vary by commercial payer and plan. To start, perhaps the site could inform when a carrier actually has it added to their databases per below and then when their internal approval process is complete? I only know about Cigna but no companies we know of so far have completed the process, unsurprisingly. We may unfortunately be looking at months.
I‚Äôve been in touch with someone in Market Access for Invivyd, I believe it‚Äôs his colleague you spoke with. He shared some helpful information and is also trying to get specific information from Cigna:
‚ÄúOnce a new drug is approved (authorized in this case), it typically will not be recognized by the insurance company until the product NDC (drug code) and product description has loaded into one of the drug compendia databases. Until then, case managers and appeals managers have nothing in their ticket with which to open a ticket upon inquiry from physician or patient‚Äù. (This is why they suggested I use the Medicare CMS code) ‚Ä¶The cycle by which Payers add new drugs to their systems varies. Once a new drug is added, there will be a period of one to several months where the insurance company meets internally, speaks with clinicians, and develops a coverage policy and criteria for use. This usually means there is a drug-specific Prior Authorization form to be completed by the provider before approval. However, in the meantime, most insurance companies do have a general Prior Authorization template or an appeals process where your provider could add the drug NDC and name manually and submit for a manual review - of course pending he drug code being in he system‚Ä¶.one last thought - health system physicians often begin the insurance verification process using their Electronic Health Records (EHR) portal. Similar to insurance companies, the health system needs to meet and review new drugs and make decisions to add new products to the lists in the ENR so a product can be ordered internally, or insurance approval begin within the portal in some cases. If your provider is not finding the new drug in the EHR, it may be possible for them to reach out directly to the insurance company‚Äù.
I‚Äôm not sure how helpful that is in terms of what the site could help provide but hopefully it gives an idea what we‚Äôre facing. I fear it will be a labor intensive process and very lucky if any of us manage to get anywhere before those insurance company processes are complete.
Please let us know how we can help support you if you move forward.


Message to Doctor:

Sharing a note I wrote in my portal for my local hospital system. I found I hit a brick wall with them despite starting the process - or so I thought - within hours of the EUA. Speaking with pharmacists and nurses yesterday it was obvious once the request left my ID physician the other parties were clueless and did nothing so far. After all this time I got a call saying it wasn‚Äôt in their system ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è This is a different entity than Paragon. Perhaps this summary will help others in pursuit or in a similar situation:
‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the pertinent info consolidated. May be helpful for easier explanation and reference.
Pemgarda is requested for (patient name).
Pemgarda is a pre-exposure prophylactic monoclonal antibody recently given Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA for prevention of Covid in high risk patients. It is given by IV.
The drug will need to be added to the (institution name) formulary.
It can be ordered from major distributors, details in this ordering guide: https://www.pemgarda.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/PEMGARDA-Product-Ordering-Guide_041624.pdf

Provider fact sheet : https://invivyd.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/EUA-122-PEMGARDA-Healthcare-Providers-Fact-Sheet-FINAL-v1.0-22Mar2024.pdf

It will be covered by Medicare akin to a Covid vaccine.The CMS codes are Q0224 for the drug and M0224 for the infusion.
(Patient name) has (insurer name) commercial insurance. Since Pemgarda is new to the market, most commercial insurers including (insurer name) have not yet added it to their drug lists or completed normal approval procedures.
(Insurer name) advised a generic prior authorization form be submitted for the patient with the above Medicare CMS codes, marked Urgent to expedite. The Medicare CMS codes should allow the insurer to see the drug in their system where they otherwise can‚Äôt.
It‚Äôs understood this PA will be denied, however the submission should open a case so that an individual approval process can begin. Once (insurer name) has the info it needs and the process complete,they should approve.
Thank you‚Äù

Finding Infusion:
Infusion Center Finder -- Pemgarda...
if no nearby centers...
    how do you work with other infusion centers to get it in their formulary

Getting Medicare approval ... slam dunk.

Getting Insurance approval...
- hospital system or infusion center will generally start it.
- we could list the status of different insurance system.
